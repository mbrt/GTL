Graph Template Library for c++

The gtl library for c++ provides an STL-like container for graphs, 
templated over the data stored at the vertices and the edges. Various types 
of iterators are provided. The edges are directed and there are the
possibility to permits parallel edges or not.

This library was succesfully compiled with g++ ver. 4.3.2 with this cmd line
options:

> g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -ggdb -std=c++0x graph_test.cc


The CMake build system is only used to perform some cheks on the gtl template
library. If you only want to use the library you may prefer to copy only the
header files (situated in ./src). You can use the test files as exmples for
the library.
NOTE: the boost library is used to make some checks in the test files. If
you don't have it don't worry: the gtl library works only with the standard
library, you don't have to install the boost library to use it.

To make and run the tests:

> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -C ..
> make
> make test
